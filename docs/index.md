## Migrate From Ghost To MKDocs

Maybe a bit strange that I use MKDocs for my Blog, but it was neccessary to replace my old Ghost site.  
I really liked the Ghost platform when it was at 1.x version, but the new editor is not my taste, so I started to find a new platform.
I need a simple and easy to use markdown based platform, so the widely used Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress could not come into the picture. And to be honest I don't need a complete CMS system for this little site.

After some hours of researching I decided to use [https://www.mkdocs.org](MKDocs) to migrate my conetnt into it.

I know this is not a typical Blog platform, but after some hours I think it can fulfill all my needs.

## Old Content

All of old conents can be found here under the "**Old Blog Conetent**" menu.
But please aware that these conents are relally old, and I keep them only for examples. 
I think most of the tutorials could not be followed step by step, because a lot of things has been changed since these posts were written.
